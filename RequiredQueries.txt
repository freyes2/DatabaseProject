Spring 2020 – Required Queries

Undergraduate Required Queries:
Wherever a year or date is specified below, be sure to rely on either the track year or the
actual position dates from the weekly data as asked for in the problem. You will obtain
different, incorrect results if you use a different method than that specified. Be sure to
print results with 1 row per printed line– difficult to read output will be given a 0.

1) Show the entire 100 entries in the chart for position date September 7, 1968. The resulting
table should have columns: Position, Title, Artist, DateEntered, ordered by position. (100 rows)

2) Show all distinct tracks whose position data is in 1970 (not the track year, but by position
dates), which, at any time, occupied the #10 chart position (not necessarily the track’s highest
position reached). Show the song title and artist, ordered by title (43 rows).

3) What composers had their song reach number 1 for track year (not position year) 1972?
Order by composer name, showing composer name, song title, highest position (should all be
1). 31 rows.

4) What artists hit #1 in 1969, based only on the track year column, rather than the individual
position dates? Show artist, title, date peaked, highest position (should be ‘1'), order by DATE
PEAKED. 16 rows.

5) What artists also wrote the track and had their peak position in the top 20 for track year =
1973? Show track title, artist name, highest position, ordered by artist name. Should yield 40
rows.

6) Either by fancy SQL code or examination of the results of less fancy code, ascertain what 2
songs were on the chart the longest in 1972, and show the answer and the results that
provided the answer (you can hand mark the answer, need not have SQL print it. NOTE: use
the position dates within 1972, not the track year for this one!

7) Which DISTINCT songs made the chart top 10 in July of 1969? (Note: we are looking for
the position(s) <= 10 during that July time period; this is NOT the same as Highest
Position<=10... the highest may have happened outside of July!) It should be 14 rows of
unique songs. Show title and artist, ordered by artist.

8) Using the track’s YEAR field (not position dates!) to determine the year, what song titles
were performed by more than one artist for songs appearing on the chart any time in 1969?
Show song title and artists, highest position, and date peaked for each, ordered by song title
(so the same titles are next to each other) and track ‘highest’ position. (27 rows) Hint: you will
need to reference the tracks table twice, using aliases, in the same query!

9) Show the top 40 songs for the week of 1964-04-04, showing in position order (1-40) the
titles and artists. Do you notice anything unusual in the result? (40 rows)

10) What songs having a TRACK YEAR = 1968 got their highest position in the Top 10, but
never got into the Top 5? Show title, artist, and date peaked, ordered by date peaked, and
highest position (39 rows)
